## Miscrits Auto Bot

A GUI automation bot built to grind EXP efficiently in Miscrits by performing automated actions like attacking enemies and auto-capturing rare Miscrits. It uses image recognition to detect specific UI elements and simulate interactions, allowing continuous farming without manual input.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This bot relies heavily on image recognition, which may be CPU-intensive on some systems.  
It is designed to work best with Miscrits running in **windowed mode** and has **not** been fully optimized for **fullscreen mode**. For best results, keep the game window visible and avoid overlapping elements.

**Make sure to allow notifications on your phone or browser when prompted.**
